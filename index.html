      <ul>
        <li>1914 - Born in New York City</li>
        <li>1951 - he received a B.A. degree in classics from Cornell</li>
        <li>1955 - Bloom receives a PhD from Yale and becomes a member of the Yale English Department.</li>
        <li>1958 - Bloom married Jeanne Gould</li>
        <li>1967 - Starts writing The Anxiety of Influence. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which poets broke free from their precursors to achieve their own poetic visions.</li>
        <li>1985 - He received a MacArthur Fellowship</li>
        <li>1989 - Bloom then entered a phase of what he called "religious criticism", beginning with Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and Belief from the Bible to the Present</li>
        <li>1992 - In The American Religion (1992), Bloom surveyed the major varieties of Protestant and post-Protestant religious faiths that originated in the United States and argued that, in terms of their psychological hold on their adherents, most had more in common with gnosticism than with historical Christianity.</li>
        <li>1994 - The Western Canon (1994), a survey of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focuses on 26 works Bloom considers sublime and representative of their nations and of the Western canon.</li>
        <li>1998 - In his later survey, Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human (1998), Bloom provided an analysis of each of Shakespeare's 38 plays, "twenty-four of which are masterpieces."</li>
        <li>2000 - Bloom consolidated his work on the Western canon with the publication of How to Read and Why (2000) and Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds (2003). Hamlet: Poem Unlimited (also 2003) is an amendment to Shakespeare: Invention of the Human written after Bloom decided the chapter on Hamlet in the earlier book had been too focused on the textual question of the Ur-Hamlet to cover his most central thoughts on the play itself.</li>
        <li>Some elements of religious criticism were combined with his secular criticism in Where Shall Wisdom Be Found (2004), and a more complete return to religious criticism was marked by the publication of Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine (2005)</li>
        <li>2011 - Bloom began a book under the working title Living Labyrinth, centering on Shakespeare and Walt Whitman, which was published as The Anatomy of Influence: Literature as a Way of Life (2011).</li>
        <li>2015 - Works on Achievement in the Evening Land from Emerson to Faulkner, a history of American literature following the canonical model, which ultimately developed into his book The Daemon Knows: Literary Greatness and the American Sublime (2015)</li>
        <li>2019 - Works on The Hum of Thoughts Evaded in the Mind: A Literary Memoir, which ultimately developed into his book Possessed by Memory: The Inward Light of Criticism (2019), the last book Bloom published during his lifetime.</li>
        <li>2019 - Dies at a hospital in New Haven, Connecticut, on October 14, 2019. He was 89 years old</li>
      </ul>
